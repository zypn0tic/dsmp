# 📚 CampusX – Data Science Mentorship Program (DSMP) Tasks

This repository contains all my completed tasks from the **CampusX Data Science Mentorship Program (DSMP)**.  
The CampusX DSMP is a structured, comprehensive curriculum designed to take learners from the basics of programming through data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. 

Each task in this repo reflects **hands-on implementation, problem-solving, and data-driven reasoning** in the spirit of the DSMP curriculum.
